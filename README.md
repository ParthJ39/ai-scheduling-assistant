**Agentic AI Meeting Scheduler**

An intelligent meeting coordination system that autonomously schedules meetings, resolves conflicts, and optimizes calendars using AI-powered decision making.

## üöÄ Problem Statement

Today's meeting coordination is bogged down by time-consuming back-and-forth, manual conflict resolution, and inefficient calendar use challenges. 
Our AI assistant solves this by autonomously scheduling meetings, rescheduling conflicts, and optimizing calendars for maximum efficiency.

## üìã Problem Description

Current meeting scheduling involves:
- Parsing wide variety of free-form requests
- Juggling conflicting calendars and back-and-forth negotiations
- Suboptimal slot choices and manual conflict resolution
- Valuable time wasted on coordination rather than collaboration

Our AI assistant removes this burden by:
- Understanding natural-language scheduling requests
- Autonomously finding optimal meeting times
- Resolving conflicts automatically
- Continuously optimizing calendars for team efficiency

## üõ†Ô∏è Setup Instructions

### 1. Clone Repository & Setup Virtual Environment

```bash
git clone https://github.com/your-org/agentic-ai-scheduler.git
cd agentic-ai-scheduler
python3 -m venv venv
source venv/bin/activate
```

### 2. Install Dependencies

```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

Extracting Google Calendar Events - with Google Auth Tokens to pull Google Calendar Events.
```bash
1. Load user credentials from a token file.
2. Fetch events between specified start/end dates using the Google Calendar API.
````

### 3. Start the vLLM Server
vLLM is a high-performance inference engine that delivers up to 24x higher throughput than standard HuggingFace implementations through advanced memory management and continuous batching. Its PagedAttention algorithm dramatically reduces memory fragmentation, enabling efficient serving of large language models with minimal latency‚Äîperfect for real-time scheduling requests.

```bash
vllm serve \
  --model $MODEL_NAME \
  --host $VLLM_HOST \
  --port $VLLM_PORT
```

### 4. Run the Flask Application

```bash
python app.py
```
